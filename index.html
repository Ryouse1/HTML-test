<!--
This is the HTML 4.01 Transitional DTD, which includes
presentation attributes and elements that W3C expects to phase out
as support for style sheets matures. Authors should use the Strict
DTD when possible, but may use the Transitional DTD when support
for presentation attribute and elements is required.

HTML 4 includes mechanisms for style sheets, scripting,
embedding objects, improved support for right to left and mixed
direction text, and enhancements to forms for improved
accessibility for people with disabilities.
